EX4 files are compiled programs for MetaTrader 4 (MT4), a popular platform for online trading. MQ4 files are the source code of these programs, which can be edited and modified by the users. However, most EX4 files are distributed without their MQ4 source code, to protect the intellectual property of the developers.

To open an EX4 file that you want to decompile, click on the "Open" button and browse to the location of the file on your computer. You can also drag and drop the file into the software window. The software will display some information about the file, such as its name, size, date, and version.
 
## Step 4: Decompile an EX4 File
 
To decompile an EX4 file and generate its MQ4 source code, click on the "Decompile" button and wait for a few seconds or minutes, depending on the size and complexity of the file.

However, you should note that decompiling an EX4 file does not guarantee that you will get a fully functional and readable MQ4 file. Some EX4 files may be obfuscated or encrypted by their developers, making them difficult or impossible to decompile[^3^]. Moreover, some decompiled MQ4 files may contain errors or bugs that prevent them from working properly or as intended by their original developers[^1^]. Therefore, you should always use caution and discretion when decompiling EX4 files and using their MQ4 source code.
